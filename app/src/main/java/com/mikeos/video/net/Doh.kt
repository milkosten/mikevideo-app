/**
 * DNS-over-HTTPS resolver (Cloudflare).
 *
 * This device is a GApps-less ROM on flaky cellular whose **system DNS intermittently fails**
 * (`getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND` for perfectly valid hosts like the Railway cloud and the daemon's LLM
 * host). That silently breaks every public HTTPS call the app makes.
 *
 * DoH sidesteps it: hostnames are resolved by POSTing to `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query` — reached by
 * **IP**, so it needs no working system resolver to bootstrap. Falls back to the system resolver on
 * a DoH miss, so it can only help. Share one instance across clients.
